# Data for the SILVA Experiment in the RECOMB-seq 2025 Submission

This repository contains information on the 16S rRNA genes used in our RECOMB-seq experiment. The accession identifiers and their corresponding metagenomic class identifiers are listed in the file [`AccesionsWithClasses.tsv`](AccesionsWithClasses.tsv).  

## File Description
- **`AccesionsWithClasses.tsv`**:  
  - **Column 1**: Accession identifiers of the 16S rRNA genes.  
  - **Column 2**: Metagenomic class identifier for each genus in the collection.  

The genomes were downloaded from the SILVA SSU NR99 (version 138.1) database, which contains 510508 16S rRNA sequences. From this collection, we selected the 402378 16S rRNA gene sequences annotated to the genus level, spanning 9118 genera.
